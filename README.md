# frequency-learning

This project is for learning English with the help of frequency lists.
You can choose your language (currently it supports 21 languages), then
take a simple test to determine your current word knowledge, and it will
generate decks in Tinycards which include, as determined by the test,
the words they should learn, and translations of these words to their selected
language.

There is also another choice that will show the whole frequency list to the user and
let them choose all of the words they know, then it will generate custom decks for them
with all of the words that they already know excluded.
