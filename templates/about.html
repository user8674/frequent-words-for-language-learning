        This web site is made for those who want to take their English vocabulary to the next level. It uses
        a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_lists_by_frequency">word frequency list</a> 
        to measure the user's knowledge and determines which words they should learn, ordered by importance.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists">many different word frequency lists</a> that are 
        generated from different corpuses and with different methodologies. This website uses <a href="https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html#lemmatised">
        Adam Kilgariff's lemmatised frequency list</a> which is generated from the <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/bnc/">British National Corpus</a>,
        which contains 100 million words. It includes all words that occur more than 800 times in the corpus, this amounts to 6318 words in total.
    </p>
    <p>
        For practicality, this website divides the list into 11 pieces: E10 stands for the most common 600 words, E1 stands for words 5400-6000, and E0.5 stands
        for the least common 318 words in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two paths you can follow: one is the short way, which tests your English knowledge approximately and 
        generates decks for you according to which piece of the list you should strart with. The other is the long way, 
        which will basically provide you with the whole 6318 word frequency-list for you to choose which words 
        should be included in the decks that will be generated for you and which words should not. Note that in both options,
        It will take some time for the decks to be generated.
